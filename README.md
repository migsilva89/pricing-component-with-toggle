# Pricing Component with toggle

Challenge from [Front End Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pricing-component-with-toggle-8vPwRMIC/hub/pricing-component-with-toggle-BJ0dvQa85).

This is an interactive pricing component that changes the values with toggle.

Was made with HTML5 + TAILWIND POSTCSS + JAVASCRIPT 

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to install Tailwind and PostCSS.

```bash
npm install ...
```

## What I learned:

- This project was more about practice what I have been learning. 

Tips or advice on how to improve are very welcome, thank you all!
